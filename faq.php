                <h3>How does turbulence affect airplane safety?</h3>

                Turbulence, caused by changes in air movement, is a natural part of flying. Pilots anticipate and navigate through turbulence using weather forecasts, radar systems, and onboard technology. Aircraft are engineered to endure various turbulence levels safely. While it can be uncomfortable for passengers, turbulence doesn't pose a significant threat to the aircraft's structural integrity. Pilots often rely on their experience, communication with air traffic control, and weather information to choose the smoothest routes. Advanced systems like the Turbulence Auto PIREP (PIlot REPort) help share real-time turbulence data among pilots, enhancing overall safety and providing a smoother travel experience.

                Air traffic controllers play a crucial role in ensuring aviation safety by managing the orderly flow of air traffic, providing real-time instructions to pilots, and preventing potential collisions. Through radar systems and communication, controllers guide aircraft during takeoff, landing, and en-route phases. Their vigilant monitoring of airspace helps maintain safe distances between planes, especially in busy or congested areas. In emergencies, controllers offer crucial assistance, guiding pilots to navigate challenging situations. This collaborative effort between pilots and air traffic controllers is fundamental to the safe and efficient functioning of the aviation system.
